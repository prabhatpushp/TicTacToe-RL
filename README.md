# Tic Tac Toe Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
This project implements a simple neural network designed to solve the XOR problem using reinforcement learning principles. The neural network is capable of learning the XOR function through backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Features
- **Neural Network Implementation**: A customizable neural network with support for different activation functions.
- **Training on XOR Problem**: Trains the network to learn the XOR function through multiple epochs.
- **Testing**: Evaluates the trained network on the XOR inputs to display predicted outputs.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The implementation is written in Python.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and matrix manipulations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabhatpushp/TicTacToe-RL
   cd TicTacToe RL
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## Usage
To run the Tic Tac Toe reinforcement learning implementation, execute the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will train the neural network on the XOR problem and print the loss during training. After training, it will test the network and display the predicted outputs for the XOR inputs.

## Development
- The main implementation is in `main.py`. You can modify or extend the functionality as needed.
- Ensure to test your changes thoroughly to maintain the integrity of the neural network.
